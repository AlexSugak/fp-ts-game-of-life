# Conway's Game of Life with fp-ts

A practical example of using some of the [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) functions.

NOTE: This is not intended as an optimal implementation of Conway's Game of Life. I understand that id could be done with a couple of nested fors. Instead, I tried to push towards ideomatic fp-ts code as much as possible, using the Conway's Game of Life as an example of a realistic code.
